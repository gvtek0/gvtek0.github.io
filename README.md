# gvtek0.github.io

This is the repository for my personal GitHub Pages site. I will be building a similar full-stack version of this site in the coming days.

## Why now?

Ultimtely, a lot of the tools I'm going to be using to upload/update projects are things that I have used for years, however I never really took the time to put together a public portfolio. So, that is now going to be changing. It's not just to be more public with what I'm working on, but also to brush up on things that I may have been slowly fogetting.

### Just a few of the technologies I'll be working with in the coming months in order to showcase some of my knowledge...

Python Flask, MySQL or PostgreSQL, Linux, git (obviously), AWS, NGINX.

Some of these technologies, I have years of familiarity with, others I'm brushing up on, and others I'm adding to the toolbox.
