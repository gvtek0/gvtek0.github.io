# gvtek0.github.io

This is the repository for my personal GitHub Pages site. A Python Flask blog will be linked in the navbar.

## Why now?

Ultimately, many of the tools I'm going to be using to deploy projects are things that I have used for years, however I never really took the time to put together a public portfolio or couldn't because of certain projects' requirements and time constraints.

## Just a few technologies I have worked with or am working with currently:

Linux, AWS, Python, Flask, SQL (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite), Kubernetes/Docker, Ansible

I am hoping to continue working with these technologies in the future as well. Some of these I have years of familiarity with, others I'm brushing up on, and others I'm adding to the toolbox more recently. I want to be sure I'm heavily involved with using open source wherever I end up.
